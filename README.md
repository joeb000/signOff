# SignOff

SignOff is a simpler and more provable way to collect signatures on legal documents.

Traditionally, enterprise level organizations pay third party vendors for software that collects digital signatures on documents. Beside's the obvious cost to purchase and implement these products, another disadvantage of this approach is the centralization of data and workflow on this vendor's site.

SignOff uses the ethereum blockchain as a decentralized, provable workflow management solution.
